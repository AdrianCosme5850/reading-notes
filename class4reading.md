# How to make a Wireframe  

A Wireframe is a plan for a websites overall iterface and setup.  
Some people use a whiteboard or paper process to intially design their webpage.  
Three common tools for wireframing are:  
* UXPin  
* InVision  
* Wireframe.cc  

# The process  

1. Before creating your wireframe understand your audience and your competition.  
2. Create a quick reference to your research.  
3. Understand beforehand where your users are coming from and where you want them to go. Assume you know nothing about the information.  
4. Keep the intial concept simple and collaborate with others to get more ideas.  
5. From top to bottom left to right add detail. Ensure it flows properly and begin testing.  
6. Turn the wireframe into a prototype. Sketch and Figma are two good tools to use.  

Clarity, confidence and simplicity are the key concepts to remember when creating a wireframe.  

# HTML Basics  

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is code used to structure a web page and its content. 
HTML is a series of elements which you use to make content look a certain way  
Enclose content in tags to change its properties.  

There are four main parts to an element:  
1. Opening tag: \<p>  
2. Content: The cat is grumpy.  
3. closing tag: \<p>  
4. The element: Opening tag, content, and closing tag together.  

Elements can also have attributes.  
> \<p class="editor-note"> The cat is grumpy. \<p>  
class="editor-note does not change the content, but can be targeted for other purposes.  

Changing content inside an element is called nesting.  
\<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>  

Empty elements don't wrap text, but insert content nontheless.
\<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">  

# HTML webpage  

\<!DOCTYPE html> is a required preamble to make a HTML webpage behave.  
\<HTML> Wraps the entire page and is considered the root element.  
\<head> Header for all content you want to include, but not show to the page viewer.  
\<meta charset="utf-8"> Sets the character set to UTF-8 which is most languages. Prevents problems down the line.  
\<title> Sets the title showed in the browser tab.  
\<body> All the content you want to show the viewer.  

# Images 

When using images ensure you use a descriptive alt text. Visually impaired people may use a text reader to describe the image  

# Markups  

\<h1-6> Creates various heading levels.  
\<p> Wraps text.  
\<ul> Unordered list.  
\<ol> Ordered lists.  
\<li> Each item in a list must be wrapped in this tag.  
\<a> Creates a link.  

# Semantics  

Semantics refers to what code means, as opposed to how it looks.  
Presentation is the responsibility of CSS.  
Using the right sematincs benefits the webpage in a number of ways.
