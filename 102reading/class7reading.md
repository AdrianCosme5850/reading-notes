# Control Flow  
Computers execute code from the first line to the last line, unless something in the code changes the order.  
Conditional structures are a very common method to alter this flow.  
if (field==empty) {promptUser()
}  
This conditonal structure is an example of why code isn't always top to bottom.  

# JavaScript Functions  

A function is code designed to perform a task, and is called upon by other lines of code.  
A function is defined by the `function` keyword, name, then parentheses.  
Code is then placed in curly brackets to execute by the function.  
Functions, procedures, and subroutines are all very similar.  
functions compute a return value that is sent back to the caller by the `return keyword.  
functions can be used multiple times without having to rewrite code.  
You can also put in a function as a variable instead of using the function return to be a variable.  
variables declared inside the function code are local to the function and cannot be used outside the function.
