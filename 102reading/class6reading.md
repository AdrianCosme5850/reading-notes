# Javascript  

Javascript is different than Java.  
There are 4 ways to create variables in Javascript.  
* var
* let  
* const  
* nothing  

A variable that will always remain the same should be declared with `const`  
If the variable will change, identify it with `let`  
variables must have identifiers.  
let x = 5; x is the identifier and 5 is the variable.  
= assigns a value to the identifier. It does not function as an equal sign. == performs that function.  
Text strings must be written in quotation marks.  
Declare all variables at the beginning of a script.  
You can declare many variables with one statement.  
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;  
let x = "John" + " " + "Doe"; outputs as John Doe  
Putting quotation marks around a number will treat it like a text string.
