# Loops and operators  
Loops repeat an action a number of times.  
There are a variety of loop types.  

## for statements  
A `for` loop executes until a specified condition is false.  
It checks itself against the conditionExperession and terminates if it within those parameters.  

## while statement  
A while statement continues to run until a condition is false.  
Avoid creating infinte loops. There must be condition that will become false in the statement.  

## Assignment operators  
Assign value to the left operand based on the right operands value.  
* x = f()  
* x += f() means x = x + f(), same is true for -,*, and /.  
* 

## Comparison Operators  
Compares the value of the operands and returns a value whether or not it is true.  

* == equal  
* != not equal  
* \> greater than  
* \>= greater than or equal to
