# Event Driven Architecture  

## Discussion  

My group discussed three different ideas. Our first idea was to create a quiz application where a set number of people would join a room, submit a question, and then take a quiz with everyone's questions added. The right answer would be determined by what was answered the most. We called it Kahoot but Worse. Our second idea, and the idea we ended up going with was the idea rater. You can submit an idea, and receive anonymous feedback on the idea. This simple framework was something we thought was more achievable than our first idea.
