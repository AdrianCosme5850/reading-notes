# Login and Auth  

## What is Role Based Access Control?  

1. A system that restricts a user's access to a network based on their role within the organization.  
2. A management role would be able to perform get and put requests but may not be able to delete or create position within an employee management system.  
3. RBAC is an efficient way to distribute access to a network. Rather than assigning access to fit every single individuals needs, you can create a general role that performs all the duties necessary to a person in that position.  

## React libraries  

1. I think that react cookie has very robust documentation to accompany it that will help with the implementation process.  
2. React-Cookies on the other hand seems a little more intuitive at a glance.  
3. I would definately prefer react-cookie for the more robust documentation.  

## Reflection  

1. My learning goals are to learn more about RBAC as I believe this is very important to the defense industry.
