# Event driven programming  

1. Nodejs provides us with the module EventEmitter by default that can be used right away.  
2. With event driven programming we can log events and trigger them rather than calling on them from within the other object.  
3. Event driven programming allows a central hub to be used to commmunicate between multiple clients. A client can emit an event and a function can be executed in the server.
