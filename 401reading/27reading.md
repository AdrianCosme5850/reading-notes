# Use State Hook  

## Introducing Hooks  

1. Hooks were implemented to make it easier to use state between components, and to make large components less confusing.  
2. Hooks allow you to use Reacts features without classes.  
3. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.  

## Hooks API  

1. Only call hooks at the top level, and don't call hooks from regular functions.  
2. If the name starts with use and calls other hooks it is considered a custom hook.  

## The state hook  

1. Hooks are a means to reuse stateful logic, and hook into React features.  
2. When you write a functional component and need state for that component.  
3. It declares a state variable so that a value can be preserved.  
4. We pass an intial state to the usestate hook.  
5. Use state returns a pair of values. One for referencing the state, and another for setting the state.  

1. My learning goal is to better understand the complex code challenges that will be required of us during our job interviews.
