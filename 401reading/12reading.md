# Web Socket  

1. It is a communications protocal over a TCP connection  
2. The client sends a handshake request, and the server returns a handshake request.  
3. Request from the client.  

## Socket.io Tutorial  

1. The io.on() handles connection, diconnections, and events using the socket.  
2. A console log in the connection that logs unique socket ids to the server.  
3. Socket.emit sends a payload to whatever the specified emit is.  

## Socket.io vs web sockets  

1. Web sockets are the type of communication, while socket.io is a third party library that allows that communication.  
2. Use SOcket.IO when you have multiple users that need to connect to a single server.  
3. Use web socket when you just need real time communication between a server and a client.  

## OSI Model  

There are seven layers to the OSI model. You can start from the top and move down or the bottom and move up. Where you start depends on the problem and your technical expertise. Following this model is a standardized way of diagnosing and fixing problems.  


## TCP Handshakes  

A TCP three way handshake is when a machine establishes a connection from itself to a server, and then a third computer establishes a connection to the server. This gives the computers ability to communicate.
