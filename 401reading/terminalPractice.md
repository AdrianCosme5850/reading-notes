# Terminal practice  

A command line is a text based interface used to give commands to your system.  
Opening your terminal is specific to your system, however it is never too difficult.  
The shell is what you command line will look like after running.  
Bash is the most common shell.  

pwd stands for present working directory and can be used for finding where you are in the directories.  
ls lists the files in your current directory.  
Absolute paths specify where something is in relation to the root directory.  
relative paths refer to where you are in the relative system.  
The tilde key(~) references your home directory.  
. references your current directory.  
.. references the parent directory.  
cd is for changing directories.  
Manual pages are for lookin up what commands do.  
man ls looks up what the command ls does.  
man -k search term searches for the specific keyword in the manual pages.
