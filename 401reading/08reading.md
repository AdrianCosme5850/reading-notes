2. On a payroll system, you might have employees that can clock in time, and a manager that can edit and remove those times.

2. The three primary rules for RBAC are role assignment, role authorization, and permission authorization.  
3. RBAC is giving people access to a system, and making so that they can only do what they need with it. A subway employee might need to add inventory requests, however they shouldn't be able to view pay information.
