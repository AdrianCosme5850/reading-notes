# Context API  

## Context API  

1. It allows you to pass props without having to do it manually in the code.  
2. It passes something that can be considered global for all components in a tree. A specific theme for a page is a good example.  
3. It makes reuse of the components more difficult.  

## Awesome React Context Links  

1. My first takeaway form the video use the new React context API by Andrew Van Slaars is that our context will be its own component.  
2. My second takeaway from the article What's new in React 16.3 by Bartosz Szczencinski is component mount methods are considered deprecated now.  

## Additional Questions  

1. The number one thing I'm looking forward to learning is React Native to see how it will improve our applications in the future.  
2. My learning goal is definately learning how to create a theme for the our webpages using context.
