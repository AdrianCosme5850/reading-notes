# Component lifecycle/useEffect Hook  

## Effect Hook  

1. UseEffect hook performs the same functions that would normally be performed by the componenetDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount methods.  
2. It tells your react components that they need to do something after a render.  
3. It allows us to access the count state variable from the effect.  
4. You need to use cleanup after the useEffect hook to prevent a memory leak from occuring.  

## Reflection  

1. My learning goal is to learn more about the lifecycle of the React component. I feel like I have a bit of a deficiet in knowledge when it comes to that topic.
