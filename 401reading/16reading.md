# AWS Cloud Servers  

## AWS EC2  

1. An EC2 instance is a virtual machine created from a variety of assets sourced from a server farm.  
2. Running an application that is native to the cloud. AWS EC2 is a cost effective solution to running an application without a hardware investment. A High Performance Application might find that their application is more suited to the cloud, as its computing needs may be more on demand than a standard website.  
3. It is far more scalable than Heroku. 

## EC2 For Humans  

1. You cna find EC2 in the compute section of the AWS Console.  
2. A micro has 1 cpu and 1 gigabyte of ram compared to the XL which can have as many as 32 cpus and 244 gigabytes of memory.  
3. One compute cycle is the math that the cpu does in a single instance.
    Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
    Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
    Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.

## Elastic Beanstalk  

1. Elastic Beanstalk allows you to use EC2 with a simpler streamlined process to host your programs.  
2. Elastic Beanstalk streamlines the process of the deployement of EC2.  
3. Elastic Beanstalk will automatically scale the usage of your virtual machine, and it allows you to take more control when you need to.
