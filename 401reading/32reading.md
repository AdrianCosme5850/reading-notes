# Context API - Behaviors  

## Hooks and Context Example  

1. The provider gives global access to the state it is currently providing.  
2. We just import it into our component and then use the use context hook from react to act as a consumer.  
3. Our child components are wrapped in the context to provide globally accessible state.  

## Awesome React Context links  

1. My first takeaway from the article New lifecycles and context API by Brian Vaughn is that the context API was an experimental tool for many years before it was finally implemented in a more permanent way that is now encourage for developers to use.  
2. My second takeaway from the video React's all new context API by Harry Wolff is that when using class based components the context provider is very similarly structured to the state of a class based componenet.  

## Reflection  

1. My goal is to learn more about Redux as it is solving problems I haven't had yet, and may be useful in the future.
