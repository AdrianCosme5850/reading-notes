# AWS: S3 and Lambda  

## AWS S3  

1. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that allows you to store information in the AWS cloud.  
2. Creating Data Lakes for things like AI and Machine Learning that require millions of data points. Archiving data at a low cost, so that you don't have to invest in hardware.  
3. It is cost effective and scalable. Rather than paying for more hardware, and its upkeep, you can offload that burden to AWS.  

## AWS Lambda Basics  

1. AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS.  
2. Lambda can be used for tasks with a short runtime, that are self-contained.  
3. Serverless applications are generally used by companies to sidestep the need to build out large infrastructure for their servers.  

## CDN  

1. A Content Delivery Network is a group of servers that work together to provide quick access to internet content.  
2. The server that is nearest to the website visitor attempts to send them cached data. If the data is not cached, it works with other servers in the CDN to retrieve that information.  
3. CDN speeds up the delivery of internet content, and protects against certain cyber attacks, like DDOS attacks.
