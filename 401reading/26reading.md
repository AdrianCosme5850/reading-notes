# Component based UI  

## React Hello World  

1. Elements and Components are the building blocks of a React app.  
2. An element is a object representation of a DOM node, while a component represents a DOM tree.  
3. The components are very modularized and reusable.  

## Introducing JSX  

1. It couples the markup and logic together into a component.  
2. You put it into curly braces, and the return value is placed into JSX.  
3. Yes, the DOM escapes any values that before rendering, so that nothing can be run through an injection.  

## Rendering Elements  

1. A component is a specialized piece of code for React. It is designed to only be used for one specific purpose.  
2. React only updates what receives new information.  
3. React will only update the changes that have been made.  

1. I'm excited to learn React Native to make my applications more accessable to mobile.  
2. My goal is to improve the readability of my code in the React framework.
