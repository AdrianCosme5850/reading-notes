# Application state with redux  

## Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials  

1. You represent all state in your application with a javascript object.  
2. A store is essential a javascript object meant to replace an instance of state, and be accessable to any component that subscribes to that store. The reducer is a streamlined and standardized way for our components to change state.  
3. The three store methods given to us are getState, dispatch, and subscribe. They are used to get state from the store, dispatch something to our reducer function, and subscribe allows you to create an action that will be performed when state is updated.  
4. It allows you to combine your reducers into a single object, so that you don't have to write all of them out.  

1. I'm interested to learn more about the combine reducer function, as it seems like it will save a lot of work in the future.  
2. I'm looking forward to what we can end up using redux for.
