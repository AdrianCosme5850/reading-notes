# Redux - Addtional Topics  

## Redux Toolkit  

1. It is meant to simplify the process of setting up a store, reduce uncessary packages, and taking out boiler plate code.  
2. It provides simplified configuration options,  and defaults for combining your reducers and stores.  
3. Use createSlice() to create a state, and a reducer function to modify that state.  

## MobX  

1. It is a package for handling global state that aims to make it impossible to create a state that is inconsistent.  
2. It derives everything from application state automatically whenever possible.  
3. Mobx will automatically execute cde that depends solely on state, by introducing the observable annotations.  

## Tutorial  

1. My main takeaway came from learing about adding reducers to a create slice function. I didn't realize that you could add multiple. I thought you needed to create separate slices.

## Reflection  

1. I want to learn more about Mobx. After using redux I realize there are many different takes on how to manage state, and knowing different pros and cons of each is best.
