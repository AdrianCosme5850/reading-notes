# Debugging  
JS runs one line of code at a time.  
When a statement needs data from antother functinon, it stacks the new function on top of the current taskl.  
When a statement generates an error it throws an exception into the mix.  
To debug start by looking at the error message.  
This has valuable information that can tell you the error outright.  
see how far the script is running.  
Use breakpoints to see where things go wrong.
