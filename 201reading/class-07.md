# Domain modeling  
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model to solve a specific problem.  
You can create instances from constructors using the new keyword.  
this refers to the object as a variable inside the object.  

# Tables  
Tables show information in a grid format.  
the tr element creates a table row.  
the td element creates a cell. td stands for table data.  
thead is used for the header of the table.  
tbody creates a body and the tfoot is for the footer of the tablle.  
Don't use the width and spacing or border and background attributes as these are outdated.  

# Functions, methods, and objects.  
You can delete property from an object using the delete keyword.  
Use dot notation to access object properties.  
hotel.checkAvailavility() accesses the method stored in the hotel object.  
this is a keyword which refers to the object the method is created in.  
Arrays are an object where the key is actually defaulted to an index number.  
DOM stands for document object model.  
it can be accessed using dot notation with the document.
