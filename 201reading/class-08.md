# Layout  
In the early internet the table element was used to make anything more complex than a simple document.  
CSS being adopted by most browsers in the late 90s added much welcome functionality.  
Display determines if the box it is applied to acts as an inline or as a block.  
flex properties allow alignment, ordering, and flow to be controlled.  
Grid is similar to flex, but is designed to control multi-axis layouts rather than single.  
Grid and flex can be combined to creat complex page layouts.  

# Flows  
* Normal: every block level element starts a new line.  
* relative: Shifts the postion slightly in relation to the previous element.  
* Absolute: Does not effect the positoning of other elements, stays with the user as they scroll.  
* fixed: Stays in the same spot regardless of where the user is in the page.  
* floating: Floating the element becomes block level which other content flows around.
