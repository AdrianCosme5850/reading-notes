# Past, present, and future of local storage  
Cookies were invented early in the internet's history, however they have several downsides over local storage.  
* Transmit redundant data every time a web page is loaded.  
* Sends the data unencrypted.  
* Only allow around 4KB of data.  
HTML5 storage stores data within the data browser, but not transmit it to the web server.  
You can only store 5 mb of data on the browser with no way to ask the user for more.  
This data is stored as strings and must therefore be converted to and back for use in an application if numbers are present.
