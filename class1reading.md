# MarkDown notes
### Basic Syntax
Always put a space after a number sign.  
The = sign and and the - sign correspond to the largest heading size and second largest respectively.  
Never indent paragraphs as it creates unexpected formatting errors.  
Add two or more spaces and hit enter to create a line break.  
One * or _ makes a word *italicized*
Two ** or __ make a text **bold**.  
Three *** or ___ makes a word ***bold and italicized***.  

> This symbol > makes a block quote.  
> multiple lines with > make the block quote longer.
> > Doubling the >> makes the block quote nested.  
> > Ensure to add a blank line before and after block quotes for compatability purposes.  

Symbols -, *, and + can all be used to create unordered lists.  
You can indent the lists to create a sub list.  
Don't use a number followed by a period when making an unordered list for some reason?  
* You can preserve the continuity of the list by pressing tab before adding an extra element.  
  Info  
* Now the list is preserved.  
You can use the backtick key for denoting a line of code.  
Use two backticks before and after the line to ignore the backticks.  
I got all this information from a single [webpage](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ "Meow")  
Use brackets for the word you want to be the link, then follow it up with parentheses of the URL.  
Quotation marks after the URL can change the popup text that appears.  
Angle brackets < can be used to quickly paste a URL. <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>  
You can also use a reference style system for your links [Cats][1]
