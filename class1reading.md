# MarkDown notes
### Basic Syntax
Always put a space after a number sign.  
The = sign and and the - sign correspond to the largest heading size and second largest respectively.  
Never indent paragraphs as it creates unexpected formatting errors.  
Add two or more spaces and hit enter to create a line break.  
One * or _ makes a word *italicized*
Two ** or __ make a text **bold**.  
Three *** or ___ makes a word ***bold and italicized***.  

> This symbol > makes a block quote.  
> multiple lines with > make the block quote longer.
> > Doubling the >> makes the block quote nested.  
> > Ensure to add a blank line before and after block quotes for compatability purposes.  

Symbols -, *, and + can all be used to create unordered lists.  
You can indent the lists to create a sub list.  
Don't use a number followed by a period when making an unordered list for some reason?  
* You can preserve the continuity of the list by pressing tab before adding an extra element.  
  Info  
* Now the list is preserved.  
``You can use the ` for denoting a line of code.``  
Use two backticks before and after the line to ignore the backticks.
