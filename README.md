# The Growth Mindset  
The Growth Mindset is basically viewing challenges not as a time sink but an opportunity to ***grow***.  
This is opposed to someone in a fixed mindset that believes these obstacles only act as time sinks.  
A few reminders for staying in the growth mindset:  

* What doesn't kill you makes you stronger!  
* Take constructive criticism seriously and use it for self reflection!  
* People's achievements are them taking part in the growth mindset!
