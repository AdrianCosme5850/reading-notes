# Data Structures and Algorithims  

## Basic Recursion  

Recursion is when a function calls itself. Recursion helps to make the code cleaner. Loops might be better for performance, however recursions make the code much more readable.  

It is easy with recursion to create an infinite loop. To avoid this add a base case. This is where the function will not call itself.  

## Data Structures  

Compound data is when individual data is grouped together to create a more meaningful set of data.  

Big O notation is how scalable your data is. How much longer will operations take when you add more data to your data structure.  

Linked Lists is a data structure with several nodes that each point to each other to quickly. This makes it easy to add and delete items, however retrieving and searching is much more difficult.  

arrays are a group of data stacked one next to each other and stored in the computers memory. This is very good for retrieving items, however this grow in size quickly and can create problems for storing them.  

Hash tables are just objects in javascript. They are good for adding and removing, however there can be instances where the keys lead to the same spot in memory resulting in a key collision that needs to be resolved.  

Stacks is an array where you add and remove information from the ends. They are very efficient, but have limited use cases.  

Graphs are data structures similar to linked lists, however each node has more information that allows more information to be stored.  

## Big O notation  

O(1) is how long a transfer of a certain amount of data takes.  


1. How that data structure is going to scale with your data.  
2. By adding a base case to our recursive function.
