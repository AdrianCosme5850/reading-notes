# CSS notes  
Cascading Style Sheets is used to control how documents are presented to users  
Creating CSS stylesheet will provide various rules for how the web page will present the content  
Example  
>h1 {  
>    color: red;
>    font-size: 5em;  
>}
>
>p {  
>    color: black;  
>}  

CSS has various modules all relating to specific formatting challenges such as "Backgrounds and Borders"  
There are three ways to implement CSS  
* External  
* Internal  
* Inline  
External is an external document that defines how specific elements should be styled. It must be linked to in order to make changes to your webpage.  

Internal is a style sheet placed in the \<head> tag.  

Inline is placed within the specific element. This should be used sparingly.  

Whichever style is read last by the webpage is the style that will be implemented into the webpage. Except for inline which has the highest priority.  

Color can be defined using its name, an RGB value, HSL, or hex value
