Javascript is a loosely typed and dynamic language.  
Variables do not need to be defined before being declared and can be declared multiple times.  

## Data types  

* Strings, used to represent text. Written with single quotes.  
* Numbers, numeric data type.  
* Booleans, logical type, true false.  
* Undefined, not yet defined.  
* Null, defined as none.
