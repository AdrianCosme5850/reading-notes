# List Items  

List items come in three varieties. Oredered list(ol), unordered list(UL), and Definition lists(dl).
In ol and ul use list item (li) for the various items in a list. for definition list use dt for the term being defined and dd for the definition.  
lists can also  be nested inside another list.  

# Boxes  

CSS treats every HTML element like it has its own box. The size of this box can be controlled by pixel(most popular), percentage, or EMS which is based on the size of the text.  
max width and min width change how big a box will be displayed.  
Max height or min height to make a minimum or max height. This can look messy without the overflow element.  
Overflow hidden hides content bigger than the box.  
overglow scroll adds a scroll bar to the window.  
Every box has border, margin, and padding.  
space between boxes is white space.  
border width controls the width of the border.  
border style can create a variety of different borders like a dotted line or double border.  
border color for border color.  
border as shorthand allows you to specify width, style, and color in one rule.  
Adding padding can increase readability.  
Margin controls the gap between boxes.  
You can specify a width to a box then set the left and right margins to auto to center a box.  
text align center can also be used.  
Display changes an element from inline to block or vice versa.  
visabliliity hides an element, but leaves a space where the box would have been.  
display with a value of none leaves no space.  
box image splices an image around the box.  
box shadow adds a shadow effet to the box. you can specify where or how the shadow  should appear.  
Border radius allows rounded edges or more complex shpaes for the box. You can even make a circle.  

# Arrays
