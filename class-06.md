# Problem Domains  
Many of the problems programmers work on are hard to see the whole issue. This makes it more diffucult to increment work.  
Make problem domains easier by narrowing your focus or doing more research.  

# Primitive vaulues and object references  
There are 8 data types in Javascript:  
* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined  
* Number  
* BigInt  
* String  
* Symbol  
* objects  

Primitive values are the value themselves whereas objects contain a reference to said value  
Primitive values are immutable meaning they cannot be changed but objects are mutable.  

# Objects  
Objects group together variables
In objects variables are properties, and functions are methods.  
Using literal notation to make an object is the easiest and most popular way to create an object.  

# Document Object Model(DOM)
The DOM is used by browsers to save a model of the HTML page in a DOM tree.  
Finding an element in the DOM is known as a DOM query.  
The getElements command is used in a variety of ways to access DOM elements.  
When a DOM method returns more than one element it returns a nodelist.  
Use the Item tag to access elements in a nodelist.  
document. must always be used to access elements in the DOM.
