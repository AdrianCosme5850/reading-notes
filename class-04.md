# Links  
Links are created with the anchor tag.  
href element specifies what page to go to.  
the text between the anchor tags is what text will display.  
You can also use a relative URL to link to pages on the same site.  
Place pages for each section in a different folder.  
mailto: in the href will setup an email link  
target="_blank" will open a new tab when the link is clicked.  

# layouts  
Css treats elements as either inline box or block level box.  
Inline flows with surrounding text and block starts a new line.  
One block level element containg more blocks is considered the parent element.  

# Flows  
* Normal: every block level element starts a new line.  
* relative: Shifts the postion slightly in relation to the previous element.  
* Absolute: Does not effect the positoning of other elements, stays with the user as they scroll.  
* fixed: Stays in the same spot regardless of where the user is in the page.  
* floating: Floating the element becomes block level which other content flows around.  

# Functions

 You can also make a function return information in an array.  
 A final paentheses invokes the function immedialtely.
