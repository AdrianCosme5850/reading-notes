# REST  

## How I explained REST to my brother  

1.Roy Felding helped write the first web servers, and did a lot of explaining on the mechanics of the way the web works.  
2. Because all of the languages on the different machines are different, and a URL must be used to access information
3. HTTP is basically an address for information.  
4. Get retrieves information from a URL.  
5. Post adds information to another system.  
6. Put replaces information in another system.
7. Patch changes a small amount of information without changing the whole.
