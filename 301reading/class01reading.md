# Introduction to React and Components  

## Component based architecture  

Componenet based architecture is based on divinding hte probrlem into sub-problems  each with its own component partitions.  

The primary objective of this is to create reusable componenets to reduce the development cost and increase the reliability of the existing componenets.  
A component is a reusable and flexable set of functionalities.  

Componenets have many characteristics. 

* Reuability  

* Replaceable  

* Not Context specific  

* Extensible  

* Encapsulated  

* Independent  


There are many advantages to using componenet design at all levels.  

* Ease of deployment  
* Reduced cost  
* Ease of Development  
* Reusable  
* Modification of technical complexity  
* Reliablitiy  
* System maintenance and evolution  
* independence  

## Props  

Props stands for properties and passes data from one component to another.  
Props are only passed from the parent to the child.  

Props allows for dynamic outputs form the child componenet.
 
1. A component is a reusable and flexable set of functionalities.  
2. The characteristics of a componenet are Reusability, replacability, extensiblility, and independence.  
3. The main advantages of using componenet based architecture is ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of developement, reusablity, and reliability.  
4. Props is short for properties.  
5. Props pass data from one componenet to another.  
6. Prop data flow is uni-directional form the parent to the child only.
