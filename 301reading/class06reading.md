# Pair Programming  

The six reasons for pair programming are:  
1. Greater efficiency  
2. engaged collaboration  
3. to learn from fellow students  
4. to practice socia skills  
5. To practice for job interviews.  
6. To give an edge in work environment readiness  

In my experience the best reason is to learn from fellow students. Whether you are teaching code or learning it, pair programming gives a great understanding of the code you are writing.  

Pair programming usually involves a driver and a navigator. The navigator tells the driver what to write, and how to write it. .
