# Functional Programming  

## Functional Programming concepts  

1. Treating computations as mathematical funcitons and avoiding changing state and mutable data.  
2. A function that gives the same results with the same input, and has no observable side effects.  
3. It is much easier to test the code.
4. Immutable data is data that cannot be changed after it is created.  
5. Referential transparency is when a function yields the same result given the same input.  

## Modules and require  

1. a Module is a section of code that is put in a different file to enhance the readability of your code.  
2. The word require imports a module into your main js file.  
3. Pass require the string path to your file.
4. Export the functions you need with module export.
