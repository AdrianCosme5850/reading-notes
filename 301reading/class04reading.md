# Forms  

Forms naturally keep some internal state.  
Having a javascript function that controls this state is called a controlled component.  
Instead of storing the state in the form it is handled by a component.  
Writing a controlled component requires more code, however that value can now be spread to other components.  
A text area tag uses the value attribute rather than a string.  
As the user enters it to update what the user is submitting.  
The function can change the value of the state data, which can then be targeted.  

  

# Ternary  

The ternary is a conditional operator that requires less lines of code than an if statement.  
x===y ? consol.log(true) : console.log(false);
